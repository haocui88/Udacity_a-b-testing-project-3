# Udacity_a-b-testing-project-3

## Introduction
**A/B tests** are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists.
For this project, I attempted to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. My goal is to work through the notebook I uploaded to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.








## Installation 
The pakages I used in the analysis are liseted as follow.
```
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import random
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
```







## Method
In this project, I run the hypothesis test by using jupyter notebook to understand the p-value of our hypothesis
and if we should accept the null hypothesis. Also, I  conducted regressions analalysis to see that the result I acheived in the A/B test can also be acheived by performing regression.
